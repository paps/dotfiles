Martin's dotfiles
=================

My Debian Sid dotfiles for desktops or laptops. For a minimal server configuration, use https://github.com/paps/dotfiles-server

### Install

Debian testing netinst from http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/ (or even better, take one that includes non-free firmware: http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/)

Easiest way to make a bootable usb disk: `sudo umount [...]` then `sudo cp debian.iso /dev/sdX`

Install settings: full disk encryption, no root password, user `paps` in sudoers, `en_US.utf8` locale, `American English` keyboard, no additionnal packages except `Standard system utilities`, `SSH server` and optionally `Laptop` (if available).

Optimal setup procedure:

* `sudo apt install vim`
* `sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list`
	* `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free`
	* `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free`
* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt dist-upgrade`
* `sudo apt install xinit openbox xterm`
* `exec startx`
* `sudo apt install htop chromium firefox geany`
* `cd ~ ; rm -fr Videos Pictures Music Documents Desktop Public Templates`
* `sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf` (allows bitmap fonts in the standard font list)

### Packages

* Install: `bc htop neovim vim xauth git zsh tmux tree curl inotify-tools trash-cli wget dnsutils apache2-utils p7zip-full unrar tig pv pydf zsh-doc vim-gtk vim-doc nmap whiptail obconf firefox gnome-terminal xterm suckless-tools feh numlockx conky-all scrot x11-xserver-utils acpi alsa-utils stalonetray fontconfig vlc gitk xfonts-terminus fonts-croscore fonts-noto-color-emoji libx11-dev build-essential xclip mplayer python3 libdatetime-perl gsimplecal gnome-calculator zenity geany thunar thunar-volman thunar-archive-plugin thunar-media-tags-plugin thunar-gtkhash file-roller unar arj lhasa rar lzip lzop ncompress rzip unace unalz parcellite ttf-mscorefonts-installer libnotify-bin gparted transmission-remote-gtk gimp ssh-askpass evince zip unzip cmake python-dev xdotool redshift pavucontrol volumeicon-alsa rsync network-manager network-manager-gnome e2fsprogs logsave arandr dbus-x11 gnome-screenshot apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg2 software-properties-common ansible ibus-libpinyin lemonbar rofi peek gpicview mate-themes gnome-themes-standard gnome-brave-icon-theme gtk2-engines greybird-gtk-theme elementary-xfce-icon-theme`
* Recommended: `intel-microcode amd64-microcode firmware-linux` (other firmware packages might be necessary)
* Remove: `notification-daemon xsel`

### SSH key

* `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "paps@[machine_name]"` (default location, strong passphrase)
* Add key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/ssh
* (Now is a good time to remove old keys from GitHub.)

**Deploying the new SSH key**

First of all, make sure all keys stored on GitHub are still valid and that each one corresponds to a known, live, accessible, owned device. Beware of keys added by tools (e.g. CircleCI) â€” these MUST be moved to a [GitHub machine user](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users), we don't want to give tools access to all our machines.

Then, proceed by SSHing into all relevant managed machines and execute `curl 'https://github.com/paps.keys' > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on each. (The `cat` command is added to visually confirm we're not losing access to the machine by mistake.)

### SSH server

**Important:** Set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

### Install the dotfiles

* `git clone git@github.com:paps/dotfiles.git`
* `cd dotfiles`
* Create all the required links: `./setup.sh [absolute-path-to-dotfiles]`

### Shell

* `whereis zsh`
* `chsh -s [absolute-path-to-shell]`

### Neovim

* Only once, before first run: `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
* Only once, to initialize plugins: `nvim -u ~/.paps/vim/bundles.vim +PluginInstall`
* For updating installed plugins: `nvim +PluginUpdate`
* For installing a new plugin added in `bundles.vim`: `nvim +PluginInstall`
* Often needed after updates or installs: `nvim +UpdateRemotePlugins`
* For removing unused plugins: `nvim +PluginClean`

### Optional: Monitoring

* **TODO**: Describe collectd install
* Go to https://papertrailapp.com, login, follow instructions to add a system.
	* Configure TLS encryption: http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/encrypting-remote-syslog-with-tls-ssl/#rsyslog
	* Use better settings for the rsyslog queue: http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/advanced-unix-logging-tips/#rsyslog_queue
	* Dont forget the `rsyslog-gnutls` package

### Rescuetime

Go to https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard and install the Debian package. It is automatically started by `~/.paps/openbox/autostart.sh`.

### Node & NPM

If needed, install Node from a Nodesource Debian distribution: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

Great to have globally: `sudo npm install -g jsonlint typescript uglify-js http-server eslint neovim phantombuster-sdk`

After having installed TypeScript, for completion support, do this: `cd ~/.vim/bundle/nvim-typescript ; ./install.sh`

If you want to have a Node binary from Nodesource of a lower version than what's available in the Debian unstable repos, use pinning, e.g. edit `/etc/apt/preferences.d/99priority-to-nodesource` with this:
```
Package: *
Pin: origin deb.nodesource.com
Pin-Priority: 1001
```

### Local binaries

Add local binaries in `~/.paps/bin` (it's in $PATH).

### Firefox

* Install Bitwarden: https://bitwarden.com/download/
* Bitwarden configuration (most defaults are fine except these):
	* Set "Clear clipboard" to 5 minutes
	* Don't show cards on tag page
	* Don't show identities on tab page
	* Disable context menu otions
* Synchronize Firefox
* Remove URL bookmark star shortcut (right click)
* In "customize mode", remove URL bar spacers, enable Solarized fox theme, etc
* Go into the default profile folder `~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXX.default-release` then:
	* `mkdir chrome`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/userChrome.css chrome/`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/userContent.css chrome/`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/user.js .`
* Rescue Time configuration (if asked):
	* Check "already using the full rescue time app"
	* Enter email
* Stylus configuration:
	* Go to options and enable `Sync to cloud` with personal Google Drive
* uBlock configuration:
	* In the "Settings" tab:
		* Tick "Enable cloud storage support"
		* Untick "Make use of context menu where appropriate"
	* In the "Filter lists" tab:
		* Set the machine's name (top-right cogwheel)
		* Pull the lists from cloud storage

### Configure openbox & conky

* `cd dotfiles/openbox`
* `cp rc.xml.dist rc.xml`
	* Set the dock floating position in `<dock>` (depends on the Xorg position and height of the left monitor) (or use `obconf` later and visually place the dock)
	* Optionally set the margins in `<margins>` (a 34px left or right margin is necessary for conky)
* `cp time_conkyrc.dist time_conkyrc`
	* Edit the first three lines
	* `gap_y` depends on the Xorg position of the left monitor, the default of 1 is fine in most cases
* `cp stats_conkyrc.dist stats_conkyrc`
	* Edit the first three lines
	* `gap_y` depends on the Xorg position of the left monitor, should be the same as `time_conkyrc` + 154
	* Identify the network interface to monitor (`downspeedf`, `downspeedgraph`, `upspeedf` and `upspeedgraph`)
	* If relevant, uncomment the battery section and identify it (`battery_short` and `battery_time`)

### Desktop notifications

* `apt install xfce4-notifyd`
* `xfce4-notifyd-config`
	* Theme: Default
	* Default position: Bottom right
	* Disappear after: 10s
	* Opacity: 100%

### Gnome terminal

* Preferences
	* General
		* Uncheck all
		* Theme: default
		* Allow blinking text: never
	* Shortcuts, everything disabled except:
		* Zoom in: Ctrl++
		* Zoom out: Ctrl+_
		* Normal size: Ctrl+0
	* Profiles: just one profile
* Profile preferences
	* Text
		* Custom font: Hack Nerd Font Mono Regular 9
		* Cursor shape: block
		* Disabled cursor blinking
		* No terminal bell
	* Colors
		* Dont use colors from system
		* Built-in scheme: Solarized light
		* Palette: Solarized
	* Scrolling
		* No scrollbar
		* Dont scroll on output
		* Scroll on keystroke
		* Limit scrollback to 10000 lines
	* Command:
		* Run custom command instead of shell: `tmux`
	* Compatibility: the default
* Useful to know: `gnome-terminal --show-menubar` and shift-right-click for context menu

### Session startup script

Optional startup script: `~/.paps/scripts/local.sh` (ignored by git, executed by `~/.paps/openbox/autostart.sh` on session start). Don't forget to `chmod +x`.

### Screensaving

In `openbox/xcfg.sh`, we make X make the screen black at 10min then shut it down at 11min.

Useful for TVs: `touch ~/.paps/x/screensaver_4h` to make the screensaver wait 4 hours before activating.

`Ctrl-Alt-L` and "Lock" from the Openbox context menu will call `slock` which will lock the screen and will wait for the correct password to be entered.

### Locales

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales`, add `fr_FR.utf8` if not present, make sure the default locale is `en_US.ut8`.

### Force default browser

* `sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser` and select Firefox
* `xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop`

### Openbox shortcuts

* `Ctrl-Alt-C` to open calendar
* `Ctrl-Alt-Y` to open calculator
* `Ctrl-Alt-S` to take a screenshot

### NextDNS

Install NextDNS' CLI client: https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/wiki/Debian-Based-Distribution

Do `sh -c "$(curl -sL https://nextdns.io/install)"` then enable 'report device name', enable 'hardened privacy mode', disable 'setup as router' and enable 'Automatically configure host DNS on daemon startup'.

By default, `dhclient` is probably running on the machine, which means that the `127.0.0.1` DNS server set in `/etc/resolv.conf` by NextDNS will be overridden regularly. To continue using both the local NextDNS server and `dhclient` at the same time, edit `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf` and make sure to uncomment (or add) the following line: `prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;`

To target NextDNS' configuration on poorly configurable devices (e.g. a Samsung TV) behind the same NAT as a desktop PC, the public IP is bound thanks to a crontab entry similar to this one: `21 */4 * * * curl --fail --silent --show-error 'https://link-ip.nextdns.io/xxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy' 2>&1 | logger -t nextdnslinkip`.

### Network Manager

The NetworkManager service is not enabled by default on Debian. Normally for normal desktop PCs this would not be needed as they just connect via their wired iface automatically, but it's great to have a graphical UI for controlling some network settings.

In order to enable the NetworkManager service:
* change `managed=false` to `managed=true` in `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` to let it manage wired interfaces
* run `sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager` (and `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager` the first time)

### Mouse acceleration

Before `libinput` existed, the `xset m` command found in `openbox/xcfg.sh` had an effect. Now it's a no-op.

To disable mouse acceleration, copy `x/configs/40-mouse.conf` in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.

### Laptops

`x/configs/20-intel.conf` is an example of a good integrated Intel Graphics configuration. `x/configs/30-touchpad.conf` is an example of a good touchpad configuration. Copy these to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/` to use them.

Use `tlp` for battery optimizations: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html

* `apt install tlp tlp-rdw`
* `service tlp start`
* `service tlp status`
* `tlp-stat -s`

Use `powertop` for monitoring power usage (however, when used in parallel with `tlp`, some of the information displayed seems wrong, beware).

* `apt install powertop`

Intel driver provided by package `xserver-xorg-video-intel` is deprecated and should not be used on any recent hardware. The newer alternative is referred to as the Modesetting driver. Use that.

Install the `light` package to be able to control screen backlight brightness.

### High DPI

To switch to 144 instead of the default of 96: `touch ~/.paps/x/dpi144` (then restart X). The `xsession` defines a `$dpi` variable according to the precense of this file, which is then passed to `Xresources`. Another option is 192: `touch ~/.paps/x/dpi192`.

### Apple Wireless Keyboard

* Respect standard layout: `# echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout`
* Have ctrl & alt were it's expected: `# echo 1 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd`
* F keys are F keys: `# echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode`

### White noise focus

* Download white noise mp3 file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CduNogudNJpVzJ4-Y575vCMWpOzTVW61
* Then: `cvlc --start-time=300 --stop-time=1500 --repeat noise.mp3`

### Keybase

* Keybase can be installed from here: https://keybase.io/docs/the_app/install_linux#ubuntu-debian-and-friends
* Then, to start it: `run_keybase`
* To completely stop it: `keybase ctl stop`
* Do no forget to disable autostart with `keybase ctl autostart --disable` (https://keybase.io/docs/linux-user-guide#autostart)

### Linux kernel config

Add the following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
# --- Personal dotfiles settings below ---
# Debian's default of 8192 is easily hit, we want to be able to watch more files
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
# Much more aggresive TCP "link down" detection (~30s instead of 1+h)
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=10
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=10
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=2
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=6
```
