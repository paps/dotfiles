Martin's dotfiles
=================

My Debian sid/unstable dotfiles, mostly intended for laptops (and in particular for Asahi macbooks at the time of writing), even though they're quite versatile. For a minimal server configuration, use https://github.com/paps/dotfiles-server

### Shortcuts

Once everything is configured correctly, these useful shortcuts are available:

Sound
* `Ctrl-Alt-[` to lower sound volume
* `Ctrl-Alt-]` to increase sound volume

* `Ctrl-Alt-1` to insert current date and time

### Installing from netinst (i.e. not Asahi)

Debian testing netinst from http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/ (or even better, take one that includes non-free firmware: http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/)

Easiest way to make a bootable usb disk: `sudo umount [...]` then `sudo cp debian.iso /dev/sdX`

Install settings: full disk encryption, no root password, user `paps` in sudoers, `en_US.utf8` locale, `American English` keyboard, no additionnal packages except `Standard system utilities`and optionally `SSH server` and `Laptop` (if available).

### Suggested initial setup procedure

* `sudo apt install vim`
* `sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list`
	* `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free`
	* `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free`
* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt dist-upgrade`
* `sudo apt install xinit openbox xterm`
* `exec startx`
* `sudo apt install htop chromium firefox geany`
* `cd ~ ; rm -fr Videos Pictures Music Documents Desktop Public Templates`
* `sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf` (allows bitmap fonts in the standard font list)

### Packages

* Install base packages: `bc psmisc htop neovim vim xauth git zsh tmux tree curl inotify-tools trash-cli wget dnsutils apache2-utils p7zip-full unrar tig pv pydf zsh-doc vim-doc nmap whiptail obconf firefox gnome-terminal xterm suckless-tools feh numlockx conky-all x11-xserver-utils acpi acpid alsa-utils stalonetray fontconfig gitk libx11-dev build-essential xclip python3 libdatetime-perl zenity thunar thunar-volman thunar-archive-plugin thunar-media-tags-plugin thunar-gtkhash file-roller unar arj lhasa lzip lzop ncompress rzip unace unalz parcellite libnotify-bin ssh-askpass evince zip unzip cmake xdotool redshift pavucontrol rsync network-manager network-manager-gnome e2fsprogs logsave arandr dbus-x11 apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg2 software-properties-common ibus-libpinyin lemonbar rofi xss-lock xsecurelock`
* Install fonts: `xfonts-terminus fonts-croscore ttf-mscorefonts-installer fonts-inter fonts-inter-variable fonts-hack fonts-open-sans`
* Install themes: `mate-themes gtk2-engines greybird-gtk-theme elementary-xfce-icon-theme`
* Install utilities: `gnome-screenshot peek gpicview ansible scrot vlc mplayer gparted transmission-remote-gtk gimp gsimplecal qalculate geany`
* Recommended: `intel-microcode amd64-microcode firmware-linux` (other firmware packages might be necessary)
* Remove: `notification-daemon xsel`

### SSH key

* `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "paps@[machine_name]"` (default location, strong passphrase)
* Add key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/ssh
* (Now is a good time to remove old keys from GitHub.)

**Deploying the new SSH key**

First of all, make sure all keys stored on GitHub are still valid and that each one corresponds to a known, live, accessible, owned device. Beware of keys added by tools (e.g. CircleCI) â€” these MUST be moved to a [GitHub machine user](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users), we don't want to give tools access to all our machines.

Then, proceed by SSHing into all relevant managed machines and execute `curl 'https://github.com/paps.keys' > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on each. (The `cat` command is added to visually confirm we're not losing access to the machine by mistake.)

### SSH server (if present)

**Important:** Set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

### Install the dotfiles

* `git clone git@github.com:paps/dotfiles.git`
* `cd dotfiles`
* Create all the required links: `./setup.sh [absolute-path-to-dotfiles]`

### Shell

* `whereis zsh`
* `chsh -s [absolute-path-to-shell]`

### Neovim

* Set Neovim as the "default editor": `sudo update-alternatives --config editor` then select nvim
* Only once, before first run: `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
* Only once, to initialize plugins: `nvim -u ~/.paps/vim/bundles.vim +PluginInstall`
* For updating installed plugins: `nvim +PluginUpdate`
* For installing a new plugin added in `bundles.vim`: `nvim +PluginInstall`
* Often needed after updates or installs: `nvim +UpdateRemotePlugins`
* For removing unused plugins: `nvim +PluginClean`

### Solaar

If using a wireless device of the "Logitech unifying" type, it's a good idea to install `solaar`, at least to be aware of the device battery level.

Run `sudo apt install solaar`.

`solaar` is automatically started by openbox's `autostart.sh` when it is detected as installed.

### Node & NPM

If needed, install Node from a Nodesource Debian distribution: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

Great to have globally: `sudo npm install -g jsonlint typescript uglify-js http-server eslint neovim phantombuster-sdk`

After having installed TypeScript, for completion support, do this: `cd ~/.vim/bundle/nvim-typescript ; ./install.sh`

If you want to have a Node binary from Nodesource of a lower version than what's available in the Debian unstable repos, use pinning, e.g. edit `/etc/apt/preferences.d/99priority-to-nodesource` with this:
```
Package: *
Pin: origin deb.nodesource.com
Pin-Priority: 1001
```

### Local binaries

Add local binaries in `~/.paps/bin` (it's in $PATH).

### Firefox

* Install Bitwarden: https://bitwarden.com/download/
* Bitwarden configuration (most defaults are fine except these):
	* Set "Clear clipboard" to 5 minutes
	* Don't show cards on tag page
	* Don't show identities on tab page
	* Disable context menu otions
* Synchronize Firefox
* Go into the default profile folder `~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXX.default-release` then:
	* `mkdir chrome`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/userChrome.css chrome/`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/userContent.css chrome/`
	* `ln -s ~/.paps/firefox/user.js .`
	* Firefox needs to be restarted for these to be taken into account
* In "customize mode", remove URL bar spacers, enable Solarized fox theme, etc
	* Select compact density (this is only possible after applying `user.js`)
* Stylus configuration:
	* Go to options and enable `Sync to cloud` with personal Google Drive
* uBlock configuration:
	* In the "Settings" tab:
		* Tick "Enable cloud storage support"
		* Untick "Make use of context menu where appropriate"
	* In the "Filter lists" tab:
		* Set the machine's name (top-right cogwheel)
		* Pull the lists from cloud storage

### Configure openbox & conky

* `cd dotfiles/openbox`
* Asahi
	* `cp rc.xml.dist rc.xml`
		* Then use `obconf` to eventually adjust the `<dock>` and `<margins>` values depending on screen size and notch placement
		* Top margin of 60px recommended
		* Optional: change the `stalonetray` options in `autostart.sh`
	* `cp time_conkyrc.notch.dist time_conkyrc`
	* `cp stats_conkyrc.notch.dist stats_conkyrc`
		* Adjust `gap_x` and/or `gap_y` depending on screen size and notch placement
* Non-Asahi
	* `cp rc.xml.dist rc.xml`
		* Probably left margin of 34px and top margin of 1px, and a dock X position of -1 (by setting it manually in the file) (Y position can be adjusted in with `obconf`)
		* Optional: change the `stalonetray` options in `autostart.sh`
	* `cp time_conkyrc.dist time_conkyrc`
	* `cp stats_conkyrc.dist stats_conkyrc`
		* Identify the network interface to monitor (`downspeedf`, `downspeedgraph`, `upspeedf` and `upspeedgraph`)
		* If relevant, uncomment the battery section and identify it (`battery_short` and `battery_time`)

### Desktop notifications

* `apt install xfce4-notifyd`
* `xfce4-notifyd-config`
	* Theme: Default
	* Default position: Bottom right
	* Disappear after: 10s
	* Opacity: 100%

### Gnome terminal

* Preferences
	* General
		* Uncheck all
		* Theme: default
		* Allow blinking text: never
	* Shortcuts, everything disabled except:
		* Zoom in: Ctrl++
		* Zoom out: Ctrl+_
		* Normal size: Ctrl+0
		* Copy and paste: Ctrl+Shift+c, Ctrl+Shift+v
	* Profiles: just one profile
* Profile preferences
	* Text
		* Custom font: Hack Nerd Font Mono Regular 9
		* Cursor shape: block
		* Disabled cursor blinking
		* No terminal bell
	* Colors
		* Dont use colors from system
		* Built-in scheme: Solarized light
		* Palette: Solarized
	* Scrolling
		* No scrollbar
		* Dont scroll on output
		* Scroll on keystroke
		* Limit scrollback to 10000 lines
	* Command:
		* Run custom command instead of shell: `tmux`
	* Compatibility: the default
* Useful to know: `gnome-terminal --show-menubar` and shift-right-click for context menu

### Startup script

**As root:** Edit `~/.paps/scripts/root-boot.sh` as needed, then run `sudo contrab -e` and add this line `@reboot sleep 5 && /home/paps/.paps/scripts/root-boot.sh` (assuming `paps` is the current user) (a sleep is added as a cheap workaround to wait for most things to be ready, daemons to be loaded, etc).

Note: when using a home directory encrypted with fscrypt, this file needs to be moved outside of the home directory (because it will be run before the user logs in, therefore before home directory decryption).

### Locales

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales`, add `en_US.ut8` and `fr_FR.utf8` if not present, make sure the default locale is `en_US.ut8`.

### Timezone

Use `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` to change timezone. A change like this should come with a change to redshift configuration, see `openbox/autostart.sh`.

### Force default browser

* `sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser` and select Firefox
* `xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop`

### IBus input methods

By default ibus-daemon comes with `Super-Space` as a shortcut to switch between input methods (e.g. between EN and CN). This doesn't work because it conflicts with the xmodmap settings.

To fix, go into IBus preferences, and changes the "Next input method" setting to `<Control><Alt>g`.

In the Emoji tab, change the keyboard shortcut to `<Control>period`.

For Chinese input support:
* Add the Intelligent Pinyin input method
* Change Simplified to Traditional
* Change number of candidates to 6, and orientation to Vertical
* Enable dynamic adjustment of candidates order
* Sort candidates by frequency
* Important: in the Pinyin mode tab, enable Cloud Input with Baidu source

### Obsidian

Get it from https://obsidian.md/ (Asahi: get the AppImage because they don't have an ARM deb). Once installed, enable sync.

**Important:** in the settings, go to 'Sync' and check all the boxes (sync files of all types, sync all configuration), and then restart Obsidian.

Other settings to change in 'Appearance': do use 'Native menus', do use 'Native frame'. And in 'Editor': add 'French (France)' to the spellchecker.

### Network and DNS

First of all, replace the contents of `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` with this:
```
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

# Do not handle DNS, in particular:
#  - do not update /etc/resolv.conf with servers received via DHCP,
#  - and do not talk to any local DNS server daemon that might be present (in our case, systemd-resolved)
dns=none
# And just to make sure: don't send DNS information to systemd-resolved
# (i.e. leave it alone with its own config, meaning NextDNS)
systemd-resolved=false

[ifupdown]
# Make NetworkManager manage interfaces, including wired
managed=true
```

Then install `systemd-resolved` and follow the instructions from NextDNS' dashboard to properly configure `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` (basically add the 4 server lines and 1 line to force DNS over TLS) **AND IMPORTANT: add `Cache=no`** (because we want to use NextDNS' cache and not ours). When done, restart the service.

Then make sure the NetworkManager service is enabled (which is apparently not the case on Debian by default?): run `sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager` (and `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager` the first time). In any case, after the config change, make sure the service is restarted.

(To target NextDNS' configuration on poorly configurable devices (e.g. a Samsung TV) behind the same NAT as a desktop PC, the public IP is bound thanks to a crontab entry similar to this one: `21 */4 * * * curl --fail --silent --show-error 'https://link-ip.nextdns.io/xxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy' 2>&1 | logger -t nextdnslinkip`.)

To observe the current DNS configuration, simply run `resolvectl`.

If there is a need to clear the local cache (improbable as we're using `Cache=no`), run `resolvectl flush-caches`.

**Switching off NextDNS**

In some cases (such as wifi portals), it might be necessary to disable NextDNS. To do this:
1. Comment out `dns=none` and `systemd-resolved=false` in `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`
2. Comment out the 4 NextDNS server lines and `DNSOverTLS=yes` in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` (but keep `Cache=no`)
3. Restart systemd-resolved: `sudo service systemd-resolved restart`
4. Restart NetworkManager: `sudo service NetworkManager restart`

To go back to using NextDNS, do the reverse.

### Bluetooth

Install `bluetooth bluez-firmware blueman` and restart. `blueman-applet` will be automatically run on session start by `openbox/autostart.sh`.

### Mouse acceleration

Before `libinput` existed, the `xset m` command found in `openbox/xcfg.sh` had an effect. Now, as I understand it, it's a no-op.

To disable mouse acceleration for standard mice (i.e. not touchpads), copy `x/configs/40-mouse.conf` to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.

### Asahi touchpad

Copy `x/configs/30-asahi-touchpad.conf` to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.

### Laptops (non-Asahi)

`x/configs/20-intel.conf` is an example of a good integrated Intel Graphics configuration. `x/configs/30-touchpad.conf` is an example of a good touchpad configuration (but don't use this on Asahi). Copy these to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/` to use them.

Use `tlp` for battery optimizations: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html

* `apt install tlp tlp-rdw`
* `service tlp start`
* `service tlp status`
* `tlp-stat -s`

Use `powertop` for monitoring power usage (however, when used in parallel with `tlp`, some of the information displayed seems wrong, beware).

* `apt install powertop`

Intel driver provided by package `xserver-xorg-video-intel` is deprecated and should not be used on any recent hardware. The newer alternative is referred to as the Modesetting driver. Use that.

### Laptop screen backlight and keyboard light control

* Install `brightnessctl brightness-udev`
* Run `sudo usermod -a -G video paps` (assuming `paps` is the current user)
* Run `sudo usermod -a -G input paps` (assuming `paps` is the current user)
* Logout/login as a group membership was changed
* Screen backlight and keyboard light controls should now be working

### High DPI

* `touch ~/.paps/x/dpi144` then restart X for 50% more pixels
* `touch ~/.paps/x/dpi168` then restart X for 75% more pixels
* `touch ~/.paps/x/dpi192` then restart X for 100% more pixels

The `xsession` defines a `$dpi` variable according to the precense of this file, which is then passed to `Xresources`.

### Apple keyboards

* Respect standard layout: `# echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout`
* Have ctrl & alt were it's expected: `# echo 1 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd`
* F keys are F keys: `# echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode`

If such a keyboard is present at boot (e.g. it's not a bluetooth keyboard), these options should already be set by `scripts/root-boot.sh` â€” no intervention required, provided the script is correctly launched by cron on @reboot.

### White noise focus

* Download white noise mp3 file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CduNogudNJpVzJ4-Y575vCMWpOzTVW61
* Then: `cvlc --start-time=300 --stop-time=1500 --repeat noise.mp3`

### Keybase

* Keybase can be installed from here: https://keybase.io/docs/the_app/install_linux#ubuntu-debian-and-friends
* Then, to start it: `run_keybase`
* To completely stop it: `keybase ctl stop`
* Do no forget to disable autostart with `keybase ctl autostart --disable` (https://keybase.io/docs/linux-user-guide#autostart)

### Linux kernel config

Add the following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
# --- Personal dotfiles settings below ---
# Debian's default of 8192 is easily hit, we want to be able to watch more files
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
# Much more aggresive TCP "link down" detection (~30s instead of 1+h)
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=10
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=10
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=2
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=6
```

### Notification of jack plugged in/plugged out

In `/etc/acpi/events/notify-jack` (this is a new file), put the following:
```
event=jack/.*
action=su paps -c 'bash /home/paps/.paps/openbox/publish-notification.sh "%%{r}%e"'
```
There are ways to make the daemon take this change into account, but a reboot should do the trick.

### Notification of AC adapter plugged in/plugged out

In `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ac-adapter.rules` (this is a new file), put the following:
```
SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ATTR{online}=="1", ACTION=="change", RUN+="/usr/bin/su paps -c 'bash /home/paps/.paps/openbox/publish-notification.sh %{c}Plugged-in'"
SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ATTR{online}=="0", ACTION=="change", RUN+="/usr/bin/su paps -c 'bash /home/paps/.paps/openbox/publish-notification.sh %{c}Unplugged'"
```
There are ways to make the daemon take this change into account, but a reboot should do the trick.

### Power button configuration

Run `sudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf` and do the following:
* Find `HandlePowerKey`, uncomment it and set it to `ignore` - resulting line: `HandlePowerKey=ignore`
* Find `HandlePowerKeyLongPress`, uncomment it and set it to `poweroff` - resulting line: `HandlePowerKeyLongPress=poweroff`

### Apple Color Emoji

Download the latest [AppleColorEmoji.ttf](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux/releases) and put it in `fonts/` (it's already ignored by .gitignore) (`fonts/fonts.conf` is already configured to trigger the use of Apple Color Emoji for emojis).

Note: It is not clear to me how fonts take priority over others. For Apple Color Emoji to work well, it's best to uninstall other emoji fonts such as `fonts-noto-color-emoji`.
